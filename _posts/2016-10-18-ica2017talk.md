## Analyzing the Interplay between Online and Offline Human Behaviors Using Mobile Data

### Abstract (150-200 word)

Digital media, especially Internet and smartphones, provides a new lens to study human behaviors in both the physical space and the virtual world. Researchers are getting more interested in studying the relationship between online and offline human behaviors. With the widespread use of mobile computing devices in contemporary society, our trajectories in the physical space and virtual world are increasingly closely connected. Using the anonymous smartphone data, we can study the interplay between online and offline human behaviors by constructing the mobility network (offline) and the attention network (online).
