###One Second on the Internet

One second doesn’t seem like much time, but a lot can happen. In one second, there are approximately 200 posts on Reddit, 4,000 tweets on Twitter, and 50,000 likes on Facebook. Visualizing the traffic the Internet experiences is very difficult. Once the numbers get so big, they start to lose meaning to us. This is why “One Second on the Internet” provides an illustration of how much activity takes place in such a small unit of time.
