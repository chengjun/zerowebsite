## Merge PDFs

Open both of the PDF documents that you would like to merge in Preview. If they do not automatically open in Preview, you can force them to open in the program by right-clicking on the document, then choosing "Open With" and selecting "Preview." When they open, they will each be displayed in their own Preview window.

Open the Preview sidebar if it is not already open by clicking "View," then "Show Sidebar."

Drag the individual pages from the sidebar of one PDF to the sidebar of the other PDF. Drop the pages in the location of the PDF that you would like them to be displayed. Hold the command key while selecting pages to select multiple pages.

Click "File," and select "Save" to save the document or select "Save As" to save the merged PDF file as a new file, while retaining a copy of the original on your hard drive.
